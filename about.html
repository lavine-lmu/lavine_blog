<p>Hello everyone! My name is Wen Lai, who is a first-year PhD student in <a href="https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/">Center for Information and Language Processing</a> at <a href="https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html">LMU Munich</a> under the supervison of <a href="https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~fraser/">Prof. Alexander Fraser</a>. I am broadly interested in machine translation, especially in low-resource languages. In addition machine translation, I am also interested in many other Natural Language Processing Tasks.</p>

<p>In the blog, I am going to write my remarks and comments on natural language processing, machine translation, and their potential social impact. The following things are planning to be presented in the blog:</p>

<ul><li>paper reading notes in NLP/MT/AI/DL areas;</li><li>technical reports in coding;</li><li>some useful tools for research;</li><li>problems encountered in my research;</li><li>etc.</li></ul>

<p>I will share the notes of some survey papers in NLP areas every week. Also see in the Github [https://github.com/lavine-lmu/nlp<em>survey</em>paper<em>notes](https://github.com/lavine-lmu/nlp</em>survey<em>paper</em>notes.git)</p>

<p>Any questions, please feel conveninet to let me know through <a href="mailto:lavine@cis.lmu.de">lavine@cis.lmu.de</a>.</p>
