# **Welcome to Wen Lai's Blog!**



Hello everyone! My name is Wen Lai, who is a first-year PhD student in [Center for Information and Language Processing](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/) at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html) under the supervison of [Prof. Alexander Fraser](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~fraser/). I am broadly interested in machine translation, especially in low-resource languages. In addition machine translation, I am also interested in many other Natural Language Processing Tasks.



In the blog, I am going to write my remarks and comments on natural language processing, machine translation, and their potential social impact. The following things are planning to be presented in the blog:

- paper reading notes in NLP/MT/AI/DL areas;
- technical reports in coding;
- some useful tools for research;
- problems encountered in my research;
- etc.

I will share the notes of some survey papers in NLP areas every week. Also see in the Github [https://github.com/lavine-lmu/nlp_survey_paper_notes](https://github.com/lavine-lmu/nlp_survey_paper_notes.git)

Any questions, please feel conveninet to let me know through <lavine@cis.lmu.de>.
